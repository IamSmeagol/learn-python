# ðŸ§  How to Turn Pseudocode into Python Code

## Step 1: Think about what you want your code to do and break it down into smaller steps in simple english.

> (This is called **pseudocode** â€” it just explains the steps, not real code yet.)

**Example pseudocode:**

- Ask the user for their name
- Say hello to the user

---

## Step 2: Turn each line of pseudocode into real Python commands.

**Example translations:**

- **"Ask the user for their name"** â†’ In Python, you use `input()` to get typing from a user.

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
```

- **"Say hello to the user"** â†’ In Python, you use `print()` to show something on the screen.

```python
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

## Step 3: Test your code by running it!

See if it does what you wanted.

> If it doesn't, fix it. (Thatâ€™s called **debugging**.)

---

## ðŸ”¥ Remember:

- Each step of pseudocode usually becomes **1â€“2 lines** of real code.
- Use `input()` when you need the user to **type** something.
- Use `print()` when you want to **show** something back to the user.

## ðŸ’¬ Extra Tip:

You can write your **pseudocode as comments** (`#`) right above your real code to stay organized!
