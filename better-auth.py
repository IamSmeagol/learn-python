#  1. Make a SEPERATE FILE called credentials.py

#  2. In that NEW file, create a variable called username and a variable called password

#  3. Assign the username and password variables to the values you want

#  4. Import the username and password variables from the credentials.py file into the THIS file (from credentials import username, password)

#  5. Ask the user to enter a username 

# 6. Ask the user to enter a password

# 7. Use a while loop to keep asking if the username OR password is wrong:
    # 8. Tell the user "Incorrect, try again"
    # 9. Ask again for the username
    # 10. Ask again for the password

# 11. When the username AND password are correct, say "Access granted!"

# 12. BE CREATIVE!  Add some extra features to this code.  For example, you could add a limit to how many times the user can try to enter the username and password, maybe add a password hint, etc.
